;;; Commentary:

;; This file should be loaded only if "ttf-fonts" module (from
;; "stumpwm-contrib" modules) is loaded.

;; This font setting is extracted from my main configuration to avoid a
;; potential error: if "ttf-fonts" module is not loaded, stumpwm fails
;; to read the following lisp expression, as `xft:font' class is used
;; there.

;;; Code:

(in-package :stumpwm)
